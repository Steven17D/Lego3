Further Reading
---------------
The plugin part is a little complicated and the development of the libs/tests doesn't demand the
understanding of how the plugin works.

However, if you would like to go deeper into the project, you are more than welcomed to read
lego/pytest_lego directory files and lego_manger/lego_manager file.
`Pytest - writing plugins <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html>`_ can help you
to understand the pytest hook better.
